And the emojis in the text messages. It won't load those, much less any pictures or gifts or anything that people send to me. And whenever I tried to. Stream videos that are a higher resolution, like, on Youtube, it just completely crashes the app. It just can't handle that kind of resolution. So you can even take pictures on this thing either because they're so out of focus. It's just super disappointing, especially since I got the platinum plan for my whole family.
